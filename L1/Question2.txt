If the definition of a fraction were to be changed to:
"A fraction is a number a/b where a,b are integers, b is non-zero and the greatest common denominator of (a, b) is 1."

Then I would create a new function called getGCD and it would determine the greatest common denominator of the 
numerator and denominator of each fraction. Every time a new fraction is created getGCD would be called 
(in createFraction, in add and in multiply). I would also create another function called simplifyFraction which would 
be called when a fractions GCD is not 1. simplifyFraction would take in a fraction, use its GCD it simplify it 
(divide both the numberator and denominator by the GCD), and return the new simplified fraction. simplifyFraction would
be called by createFraction, add and multiply after it has called getGCD and the GCD is not 1.
